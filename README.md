# Project 1: LLM Setup and Basic Chatbot

## Project
This project is the foundation of an AI-powered chatbot built using a Large Language Model (LLM) API. By Day 7, it will evolve into a command-line chatbot with token usage tracking, cost awareness, structured JSON outputs, and optimized prompt handling. The goal is to deeply understand how LLMs work in real-world applications.

## Provider
OpenAI (GPT-based models)
